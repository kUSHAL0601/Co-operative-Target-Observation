PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================
+ We want to introduce obstacles into this setup.
+ We will have targets that try to move out of sight by moving away or by moving behind obstacles.
+ Observers can observe for certain radius but not in the arc cut off by obstacle
+ Introducing ways in which we can model this setup (i.e. what sort of obstacles we can introduce etc.)
+ Develop heuristics for the observer and target.

APPROACH
========
