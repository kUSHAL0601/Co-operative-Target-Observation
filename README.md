# BRLP-CTO-ALGORITHM
+ A python implementation for the BRLP-CTO algorithm for drone survelliance with controlled randomization
+ USE main_vmd to visualize it in vmd. Simply redirect it to animation.xyz file and run it in vmd
<<<<<<< HEAD
+ Research Paper is implemented by default in main.py

# Progress of work
+ Introducing controlled randomization to make my movement pattern not guessable

=======
+ Multiple work- env and algos implemented
+ README to be updated
+ WARNING: REPO TOO BIG SO BEWARE WHILE CLONING!
